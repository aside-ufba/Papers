			 & \bf Facet & \bf Description \\
			\hline
			\bf 1 	& \small \bf Software Engineering Area 
            		& The SE topic(s) addressed in the study 
(software engineering in general, requirements, models and methods, design and architecture, quality, testing, evolution and maintenance, development and construction, process, management and configuration management), based on the SWEBOK \citeyearpar{swebok}. \\
			\bf 2 & \small \bf Research Type & The research approach used in the paper 
            	(experience report, case study, action research, experiment/quasi-experiment, survey, opinion paper, solution proposal, philosophical paper
            -- adapted from \citet{Petersen}). \\
%Table~\ref{tab:researchTypeStudies} provides a description of each category,  \\
%			\bf 3 & Learning Approach & The pedagogical approach that was applied together with OSP in SE courses. Table~\ref{tab:activeLearning} presents a description of each category. \\
%			\bf 4 & Assessment Perspective & The perspective from which student learning is evaluated -- see Table~\ref{tab:assessmentPerspective}. \\
			\bf 3 & \small \bf Learning Approach & The pedagogical approach 
            that was applied together with FLOSS projects in SE courses 
            -- not presented in this paper. \\
			\bf 4 & \small \bf Assessment Perspective & The perspective from which
            student learning is evaluated -- not presented in this paper. \\
			\bf 5 & \small \bf Assessment Type & The instrument used to assess student
            learning -- see Table~\ref{tab:assessmentType}. \\
			\bf 6 & \small \bf Approach Goal & Which goal in introducing FLOSS projects
            in SE courses was prevalent (either learning SE principles/concepts 
            or learning to develop FLOSS). \\
			\bf 7 & \small \bf Curriculum Choice & How the content was embodied in
            curriculum -- see Table~\ref{tab:curriculumApproach}. \\
			\bf 8 & \small \bf Control Level & How much control faculty/staff 
            had on the FLOSS project -- see Table~\ref{tab:controlLevel}. \\
			\bf 9 & \small \bf Project Choice & How the FLOSS projects were chosen  -- see Table~\ref{tab:projectChoice}. \\
